# Problem
    Stack is a data structure in which items are removed in the reverse order from that in which they are added, so the most recently added item is the first one removed. 
    This is also called last-in, first-out (LIFO).
    Queue is a data structure in which the items are kept in the order in which they were inserted, and the primary operations are enqueue (insert an item at the end) and dequeue (remove the item at the front).
    This is also called first-in, first-out (FIFO).

    Challenge: Write a stack. Once you're done, implement a Queue using two Stacks.
    Write tests for your functional Queue (stack would be tested indirectly).

    Start with the prototypal pattern, once that is functional, refactor code into 
    modular and OLOO.

    Consider committing your three versions of this challenge to github, it could server as a good refresher later.
